# CleanStart
CleanStart is dedicated to reshaping the landscape of software supply chain security. With seamless integration, combined with continuous monitoring and vulnerability intelligence, CleanStart provides a platform that secures every step from development to delivery.

Our main goal is to make security easy for users while taking on the hard work of finding and fixing security issues. Here's how we do it:

Developer Harmony: We try to make security fit seamlessly into developers' work so they can keep moving fast without sacrificing safety.

Security Empowerment: With our tools, security teams can set up strong security rules and make sure they're followed, keeping the whole supply chain safe.

We are committed to enabling faster detection and response to threats, increasing trust, and empowering organizations to develop software with confidence by minimizing developer disruption and empowering security teams.

## CleanStart Container Images
CleanStart have built community edition of Docker container images available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/cleanstart). CleanStart Community team is continuously building sample applications, how-to guides for running CleanStart images and making them available on [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/cleanstart-containers). The aim of such sample projects is learning containerization, web development, and DevOps practices. Each container includes practical examples, setup scripts, and detailed documentation to help you learn and implement containerized solutions.
